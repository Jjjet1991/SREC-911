        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
            SREC 911 call receivers answer 911 and Crime Check calls from the public. They triage all the calls 
            that come into the center. The information is then sent to Fire or Law Dispatch. From there the information is
            relayed to responders. Crime Check reports are also written by report techs. These reports are then forwarded to appropriate
            agency for further follow up and investigation as needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Why we are different</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike a majority of communication centers across the nation SREC has some unique attributes. At SREC law, fire and 911 are
            separate skill sets. That means that each discipline (law, fire and 911) receive specialty training in their respective fields.
            This means that during a major incident each of these three sectors pulls their resources to aid in the most effective way they can.
            Unlike other centers this allows us to efficiently handle more calls and get the appropriate responders to aid callers.
        </p>
        <p>SREC works closely with both city law and fire to provide the optimum response available. Where as other centers are limited by
            resources from outlying agencies. This relationship means that citizens get the best service from surrounding agencies as well. SREC is constantly
            looking to improve the role of telecommunications. SREC is constantly training and looking for new opportunities to expand our role in public safety.
            Whether it is an active shooter situation or massive wildfire SREC's specialization ensures that responders and citizens get the information and resources they need.
